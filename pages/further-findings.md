title: Further Findings While Building This Site
short-title: Further Findings
date: 2022-01-01

This is mostly a (relatively) unordered list of various things I discovered building this Flask site (and generating the static pages from it). Full disclosure: I am neither a webdev expert nor a Flask expert, so some of these "findings" might be obvious to the non-noobs, and there 110% might be better ways of solving these problems.
