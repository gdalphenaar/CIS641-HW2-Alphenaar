# Grant D. Alphenaar

Interests:
- Gym (powerful activity)
- Running (somewhat begrudgingly, now)
- Yoga and rock climbing (sadly, have not had the chance to do these much lately...)
- Machine learning (thesis topic) & cybersecurity (program concentration)
- Command line shenanigans (to flex on the normies)
- Messing around with tutorial projects for new languages but never finishing them...

## Technical Background

Currently, I work primarily in Python, mostly for data science-related/adjacent tasks. In the past, I also used R for a lot of these tasks (I'll still use R if I have to, but I have no real love for it other than being able to work with other R users). I started out using primarily Java (as I suppose is common) and picked up a decent bit of C/C++ along the way (as I suppose is also common), and I still have a good deal of familiarity with them, but I haven't used them in a while (aka, probably not at the level of professional work currently). I've also messed around in a few other languages like JavaScript, Go, and C#, but I certainly wouldn't consider myself terribly competent in them (aka, more hobby project skill level than professional skill level). I'll mess around a bit with pretty much anything at least once, though...
